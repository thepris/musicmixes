 Albums not included:
* Roxy Music disbanded after _Siren_ and, to my ears, wasn't the same when they came back. So while I know there is some abiding love for the late-era Roxy albums (particularly 1982's _Avalon_), I don't like them and this is my mix. So _Avalon_, _Flesh and Blood_ and _Manifesto_ are not included here.
* _Viva!_ (1976's live album) wasn't considered for this mix, but should have been. Oversight on my part.
* Non-album singles _Jealous Guy_ and _Pyjamarama+ were considered, but didn't make the cut.
* Other EPs, soundtracks, live albums, and bootlegs were either not considered or didn't make the cut.
