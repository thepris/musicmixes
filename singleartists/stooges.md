Notes:
* The Stooges only released three albums in their first go around -- almost all of it classic and all but a half hour of it can fit on one standard CD. So that's what this mix is: The Stooges original discography minus the least essential half hour worth. Sequenced chronologically, too.
* Didn't consider any of the Stooges late-Aughts ~money grab~ reunion.
* _Metallic K.O._ was considered, but none of the versions are as good as the studio versions. Other live albums were not considered.
* As awesome as this'd be with eight versions of "Down in the Street" from _1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions_, ties go to the original (released) version.
