Albums not included:
* All Post-Waters work (>1983) were not considered as a matter of principle.
* The Post-Barrett, Pre-_Dark Side_ albums don't really compare to their golden era, which is why _A Saucerful of Secrets_, _More_ and _Ummagumma_ are entirely absent here.
* Other EPs, soundtracks, live albums, and bootlegs were either not considered or didn't make the cut.
