Spotify is missing two tracks from Part II; youtube links next to the songs in this list. The first is a later remix of an obscure Boston track which seems to only exist on a couple of webpages out there (you can find a cassette rip of this release if you look, but this is the only song really worth it). The remix is close enough to the original I don't have any issues linking it. The second missing track is from The Del-Byzanteens, which I'm surprised is missing given Jim Jarmusch's (relative) popularity.
